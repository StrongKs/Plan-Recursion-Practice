I had the incredible opportunity to attend Google's inaugural Product Inclusion & Equity Summit in sunny Sunnyvale, California, and I must say, it was an eye-opening experience! üåû

Not only was it my first time in the Golden State, but the summit itself was nothing short of extraordinary. The wealth of knowledge and insights shared were absolutely mind-boggling, and I am deeply grateful for the chance to participate.

The sheer volume of information I gathered has me seriously considering putting together a blog to share these powerful insights with all of you. The discussions on product inclusion and equity were not only thought-provoking but also incredibly inspiring.

I'd like to extend a heartfelt shout-out to Kourney, Dominique, and Annie for accepting my essay as one of the winners in the contest that granted me this opportunity. Your support has opened doors to a world of knowledge, and I am forever grateful. üôè

Stay tuned for more updates, as I look forward to sharing some of the invaluable lessons and ideas that I've gathered during this remarkable summit. Let's work together to make our products and workplaces more inclusive and equitable for everyone!
