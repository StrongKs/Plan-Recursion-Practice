# Plane-Recursion-Practice
On my flight to California for Google's first Product Equity & Inclusion Summit in Sunnyvale, I decided to make the most of my time without Wi-Fi by honing my coding skills. 🚀

One area I've always wanted to strengthen is recursion. I challenged myself to tackle recursive problems during the journey, and it turned out to be quite an adventure! 😅

I successfully replicated the Fibonacci sequence from scratch, but then, I hit a roadblock when attempting to construct a binary search tree from an ordered array. 🌲 That's when something incredible happened! 🙌

I found myself fortunate to have a Software Engineer from Instacart seated nearby who noticed my struggles and decided to lend a helping hand. 💡 It was an amazing experience to witness an industry expert effortlessly tackle the same problem I had been grappling with for hours. 🤯

Not only did Gary guide me through the question, but he also imparted some valuable wisdom about recursion. 🧠 He mentioned that, in the software industry, recursive problems are often avoided in favor of iterative solutions, and they tend to be more prevalent in interview scenarios. Who knew, right? 🤷‍♂️

I'm incredibly grateful to Gary for sharing his knowledge and assisting me on my brief but enlightening journey into the world of recursive problem-solving. 🙏✨
